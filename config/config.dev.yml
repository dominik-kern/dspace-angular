# The "ui" section defines where you want Node.js to run/respond. It often is a *localhost* (non-public) URL, especially if you are using a Proxy.
# In this example, we are setting up our UI to just use localhost, port 4000.
# This is a common setup for when you want to use Apache or Nginx to handle HTTPS and proxy requests to Node on port 4000
ui:
  ssl: false  
  host: localhost
  port: 4000
  nameSpace: /
 
# The REST settings MUST correspond to the primary/public URL of the backend. Usually, this means they must be kept in sync
# with the value of "dspace.server.url" in the backend's local.cfg
rest:
  ssl: true
  host: ub-fisdev-backend.ub.tu-freiberg.de
  port: 443
